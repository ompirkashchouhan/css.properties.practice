            <h3>Breed History</h3>

            <p class="twoPara">Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet Consectetur, Adipisicing Elit. Ullam Modi Non Minima Veniam
                Culpa Deserunt Autem Quo Porro Fugiat? Sunt Perspiciatis, Illo Repudiandae Ratione Odit Tenetur
                Blanditiis Saepe Esse Dignissimos. The Briard, Which Is Believed To Have Originated In France, Has Been
                Bred For Centuries To Herd And To Protect Sheep. The Breed Was Used By The French Army As Sentries,
                Messengers And To Search For Wounded Soldiers Because Of Its Fine Sense Of Hearing. Briards Were Used In
                The First World War Almost To The Point Of Extinction. Currently The Population Of Briards Is Slowly
                Recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson And Lafayette All Owned Briards.</p>
